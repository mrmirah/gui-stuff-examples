# GUI Examples
They are example on how to use basic GUI elements built inside Java 1.8 to achieve the requirements for those labs.

It is crucial to read those specific README files to understand how to use the GUI elements required.

The order that you should examine these files is the following:
1. SimpleWindow
2. AdvancedWindow
3. NewAdvancedPanel
4. NewWindowRunner

The last two files are related to each other so they should be examined together.  

You **should** fully read the comments in all of those files as I attempted to explain out what each line or series of lines are doing in those files.  These comment should help you understand how to use the code and be able to use the code effectively in the required labs.
